        // loop from 1 to 9 cores
            // loop 100 times getting the execution time and divide by 100 to get average execution time

            // loop 100 times getting the execution time and divide by 100 to get average execution time

    // test 5 - if i can get a load bearing implementation that is good do it here similar to above

    // write to a file the average serial execution time

    // write to a file 1 - 9 core averages for rest of test cases
